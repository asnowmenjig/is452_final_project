The fury of zealots, inteſtine bitterneſs and diviſion were

King Charleſ,
Are not thoſe men too often the greateſt zealot, who are
moſt notoriouſly ignorant? true zeal ſhould always begin with
true knowledge, and thence proceed to an unwearied paſſion,
for what it once knows to be worthy of ſuch paſſion. Sprat.
No wonder that ſo many of theſe deluded zealots have been
engaged in a cauſe which they at firſt abhorred, and have wiſh-
ed or ačted for the ſucceſs of an enterprize, that might have
ended in the extirpation of the proteſtant religion. Addiſon.
ZEA'Lous, adj. [from zeal.] Ardently paſſionate in any cauſe,

It is not at all good to be zealous againſt any perſon, but
only againſt their crimes. It is better to be zealºus for thing"
than fºr perſons: but then it ſhould be only for good thing;
a rule that does certainly exclude all manner of zeal for ill
things, all manner of zeal for little things. Sprat's "":

And would love more, could I but love thee leſs. Suckling,
