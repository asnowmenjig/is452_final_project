Qy I'cksilv ER. n. ſ. ſquick and ſilver ; argentum vivum, Lat.]
Quickſilver, called mercury by the chymiſts, is a naturally
fluid mineral, and the heavieſt of all known bodies next to
gold, and is the more heavy and fluid, as it is more pure ; its
nature is ſo homogene and ſimple, that it is a queſtion whether
gold itſelf be more ſo : it penetrates the parts of all the other
metals, renders them brittle, and in part diſſolves them : it
is wholly volatile in the fire, and may be driven up in vapour
by a degree of heat very little greater than that of boiling
water: it is the leaſt tenacious of all bodies, and every ſmaller
drop may be again divided by the lighteſt touch into a multi-
tude of others, and is the moſt diviſible of all bodies: mer-
cury very readily mixes with gold, ſilver, lead and tin, by
chymical operations, but not without difficulty with copper
and iron ; and it mixes eaſily with zink and biſmuth among
the ſemimetals: the ſpecifick gravity of pure mercury is to
water as 4023 to 1000, and as it is the heavieſt of all fluids,
t is alſo the coldeſt, and when heated the hotteſt: of the va.
rious ores, in which mercury is found, cinnabar is the richeſt
and moſt valuable, which is cztremely heavy, and of a bright

in the mines of Friuli, belonging to the Venetians, in Italy,
and ſome others in Spain, Hungary, and the Eaſt Indies:
