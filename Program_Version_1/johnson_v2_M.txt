MANcriNE'el tree. n.ſ.. [man-anilla, Latin.]
The manchinzel tre, has male flowers, or katkins, which
are produced at remote diſtances from embºios, which be-
come round fleſhy fruit, in which is contained a rough woody
nut, incloſing four or five flat ſeeds: it is a native of the
Weſt Indies, and grows equal to the ſize of an oºk; its
wood, which is fawn out into planks, and brought to Eng-
land, is of a beautiful grain, will poliſh well and laſt long.
and is therefore much eſteemed in cabinet-makers work: in
cutting down thoſe trees, the juice of the bark, which is of
a milky colour, muſt be burnt out before the work is begun;
for its nature is ſo corroſive, that it will raiſe bliſters on the
ſkin, and burn holes in linen; and if it ſhould happen to flie
into the eyes of the labourers, they are in danger of loſing
their fight: the fruit is of the colour and ſize of the golden
pippen, by which many Europeans have been deceived; ſome
of whom have greatly ſuffered, and others loſt their lives by
ating it, which will corrode the mouth and throat: the
leaves of theſe trees alſo abound with a milky juice of the
ſame nature, ſo that the cattle never ſhelter themſelves under
them, and ſcarcely will any vegetable grow under their ſhade;
et the goats eat this fruit without any injury. AMiller.

MA'NNA. n.ſ.
Manna is properly a gum, and is honey-like juice con-
creted into a ſolid form, ſeldom ſo dry but it adheres more or
leſs. to the fingers in handling : its colour is whitiſh, yel-
lowiſh, or browniſh, and it has in taſte the ſweetneſs of ſu-
gar, and with it a ſharpneſs that renders it very agreeable:
we are ſupplied with manna from Calabria and Sicily, which
is the produćt of two different trees, but which are of the
ſame genus, being both varieties of the aſh : when the heats
of ſummer are free from rain, the leaves, the trunks, and
branches of both theſe trees, exſudate a white honey juice
which concretes into what we call manna, forming itſelf a.
it runs; and according to its different quantity, into ſmall
roundiſh drops, or long flakes: what flows out of the leaves
of theſe trees is all natural, but the Italians procure a forced
kind by wounding the trunks and branches: the fineſt manna
of all is that which oozes naturally out of the leaves in Au-
guſt, after the feaſon of collecting the common manna is
over: the French have another ſort of manna, produced from
the

the larch tree, of a very different genus of the aſh, and the
very tree which produces oil of turpentine ; this is called
Briançon manna, from the country where it is produced: our
black thorn, or ſloe tree, ſometimes yield a true manna from
the ribs of the leaves in Autumn, but it is in a very ſmall
quantity: there is another ſort called the manna Perſia, pro-
duced from a ſmall prickly ſhrub about four or five feet high,
rowing in Egypt, Armenia, Georgia, and Perſia. The
#., who had been acquainted with the laſt mentioned
fort of manna, when they found a miraculous food in the de-
ſert reſembling it, did not ſcruple to call it manna : this was
a conjeaure the more natural to them, as they ſaw plainly
that this deſcended from the heavens in form of a dew, and
concreted into the globules in which they found it; and the
received opinion at that time was, that the Oriental manna
was formed in the ſame manner; that it was a dew from the
clouds concreted on the plant, none ſuppoſing, in thoſe
early times, that it was the natural juice of the ſhrub upon
which it was found: it is however evident, that this was not
of the nature of manna, becauſe it melted away as the fun
grew hot, whereas manna hardens in that heat. It is but
lately that the world were convinced of the miſtake of manna
being an aerial produce, by an experiment being made by
covering a tree with ſheets in the manwa ſeaſon, and the find-
ing as much manna on it afterwards as on thoſe which were
open to the air and dew. Manna is celebrated, both by the
ancients and moderns, as a gentle and mild cathartick. Hill.

upon certain herbs, or leaves only. Bacon's Nat. Hiſł.

MANor. n.ſ.. [manoir, old French; namerium, low Latin 3
maner, Armorick.] -
Manor ſignifies, in common law, a rule or government
which aman hath over ſuch as hold land within his fee. Touch-
ing the original of theſe manºr, it ſeems, that, in the begin-
ning, there was a certain compaſs or circuit of ground grant-
ed by the king to ſome men of worth, for him and his heirs
to dwell upon, and to exerciſe ſome juriſdiction, more or
leſs, within that compaſs, as he thought good to grant; per-
forming him ſuch ſervices, and paying ſuch yearly rent for
the ſame, as he by his grant required : and that afterward
this great man parcelled his land to other meaner men, in-
joining them again ſuch ſervices, and rents as he thought
good; and by that means, as he became tenant to the king,
Îo the inferiors became tenants to him : but thoſe great men,
or their poſterity, have alienated theſe manſions and lands ſo
given them by their prince, and many for capital offences
have forfeited them to the king; and thereby they ſtill re-
main in the crown, or are beſtowed again upon others. But
whoſoever poſſeſſes theſe manors, the liberty belonging to
them is real and predial, and therefore remains, though the
owners be changed. In theſe days, a ** rather ſignifies
the juriſdiction and royalty incorporeal, than the land or ſite:
for a man may have a manor in groſs, as the law terms it,
that is, the right and intereſt of a court-baron, with the per-
quiſites thereto belonging. . Cowel.
My parks, my walks, my manºrs that I had;

MA'Re Asi TE. m. ſ. - s
The term marcaſte has been very improperly uſed by ſome
for biſmuth, and by others for zink: the more accurate
writers however always expreſs a ſubſtance different from
either of theſe by it, ſulphureous and metallick. The mar-
ca/ite is a ſolid hard foſſil, of an obſcurely and irregularly for
liaceous ſtructure, of a bright glittering appearance, and na-
turally found in continued beds among the veins of ores, or
in the fiſſures of ſtone: the variety of forms this mineral puts
on is almoſt endleſs: as it is generally found among the ores
of metals, it is frequently impregnated with particles of them,
and of other foſſile bodies, and thence aſſumes various colours
and degrees of hardneſs. There are however only three di-
ſtinét ſpecies of it; one of a bright gold colour, another of
a bright ſilver, and a third of a dead white : the ſilvery one
ſeems to be peculiarly meant by the writers on the Materia
Medica. Marcoſite is very frequent in the mines of Corn-
wall, where the workmen call it mundick, but more ſo in
Germany, where they extract vitriol and ſulphur from it, be-
ſides which it contains a quantity of arſenick. Hill,
The writers of minerals give the name pyrites and marca-
ſites indifferently to the ſame ſort of body: I reſtrain the name
of pyrites wholly to the nodules, or thoſe that are found
lodged in ſtrata that are ſeparate: the marcoſite is part of the
matter that either conſtitutes the ſtratum, or is lodged in the
perpendicular fiſſures. Woodward Met. Foſſils.

and ſulphur : with the earth alone it compounds alum; with
the metal alone, or metal and earth together, it compounds

Mildew. m. ſ. ſmilbeape, Saxon.]
Mildew is a diſeaſe that happens in plants, and is cauſed
by a dewy moiſture which falls on them, and continuing, for
want of the ſun's heat, to draw it up, by its acrimony cor-
rodes, gnaws, and ſpoils, the inmoſt ſubſtance of the plant,
and hinders the circulation of the nutritive ſap ; upon which
the leaves begin to fade, and the bloſſoms and fruit are much
prejudiced: or, mildew is rather a concrete ſubſtance, which
exſudes through the pores of the leaves. What the garden-
ers commonly call mildew is an inſect, which is frequently
found in great plenty, preying upon this exſudation. Others
ſay, that mildew is a thick, clammy vapour, exhaled in the
Spring and Summer from the plants, bloſſoms, and even the
carth itſelf, in cloſe, ſtill weather, where there is neither ſun
cnough to draw it upwards to any conſiderable height, nor wind
of force ſtrong enough to diſperſe it: it condenſes and falls on
plants, and with its thick, clammy ſubſtance ſtops the pores, and
by that meansprevents perſpiration. Miller thinks the true cauſe
of the mildew appearing moſt upon plants which are expoſed
to the Eaſt, is a dry temperature in the air when the wind
blows from that point, which ſtops the pores of the plants, and
prevents their perſpiration; whereby the juices of the plants
are concreted upon the ſurface of their leaves, which being
of a ſweetiſh nature, inſe&amp;ts are inticed thereto, where find-
ing proper nutriment they depoſite their eggs, and multiply
ſo faſt as to cover the whole ſurfaces of the plants, and, by
corroding the veſſels, prevent the motion of the ſap. It is
obſervable, that whenever a tree has been greatly affected by
this mildew, it ſeldom recovers it in two or three years, and
many times never is intirely clear from it after. Hill.
Down fell the mildew of his ſugred words. Fairfax.
The mildew cometh by cloſeneſs of air; and therefore in
hills, or champain grounds, it ſeldom cometh. Bacon.

The milky-way, or via lactea, is a broad white path or track,
encompaſſing the whole heavens, and extending itſelf in ſome
places with a double path, but for the moſt part with a ſingle
one. Some of the ancients, as Ariſtotle, imagined that this
path conſiſted only of a certain exhalation hanging in the air;
but, by the teleſcopical obſervations of this age, it hath been
diſcovered to conſiſt of an innumerable quantity of fixed ſtars,
different in ſituation and magnitude, from the confuſed mix-
ture of whoſe light its whole colour is ſuppoſed to be occa-
fioned. It paſſes through the conſtellations of Caſſiopeia,
Cygnus, Aquila, Perſeus, Andromeda, part of Ophiucus and
Gemini, in the northern hemiſphere ; and in the ſouthern it
takes in part of Scorpio, Sagittarius, Centaurus, the Argo
Navis and the Ara. The galaxy hath uſually been the re-
gion in which new ſtars have appeared ; as that in Caſſiopeia, .
which was ſeen in A. D. 1572; that in the breaſt of the
Swan, and another in the knee of Serpentarius; which have
appeared for a while, and then become inviſible again. Harris.
Nor need we with a prying eye ſurvey

MISTLE to E. m. ſ. [myrzelcan, Saxon; miſſel, Daniſh, bird-
line, and can, a twig.] A plant.
The flower of the miſletoe conſiſts of one leaf, which is
ſhaped like a baſon, divided into four parts, and beſet with
warts; the ovary which is produced in the female flowers is
placed in a remote part of the plant from the male flowers,
and conſiſts of four ſhorter leaves; this becomes a round berry
full of a glutinous ſubſtance, incloſing a plain heart-ſhaped
ſeed : this plant is always produced from ſeed, and is not to
be cultivated in the earth, as moſt other plants, but will
always grow upon trees; from whence the ancients account-
ed it a ſuper-plant, who thought it to be an excreſcence on
the tree without the ſeed being previouſly lodged there, which
opinion is now generally confuted. The manner of its pro-
pagation is as follows, viz. the miſletoe thruſh, which feeds
upon the berries of this plant in winter when it is ripe, doth
open the ſeed from tree to tree; for the viſcous part of the
berry, which immediately ſurrounds the ſeed, doth ſometimes
faſten it to the outward part of the bird’s beak, which, to
get diſengaged of, he ſtrikes his beak at the branches of a
neighbouring tree, and ſo leaves the ſeed ſticking by this viſ-
cous matter to the bark, which, if it lights upon a ſmooth
part of the tree, will faſten itſelf, and the following winter
put out and grow : the trees which this plant doth moſt rea-
dily take upon are the apple, the aſh, and ſome other ſmooth
rind trees: it is obſervable, that whenever a branch of an
oak tree hath any of theſe plants growing upon it, it is cut
off, and preſerved by the curious in their collections of na-
tural curioſities. AMiller.

Mu'MMY. n.ſ. [mumie, Fr. mumia, Lat, derived by Salmaſius
from amomum, by Bochart from the Arabick.]
I. A dead body preſerved by the Egyptian art of embalming.
We have two different ſubſtances preſerved for medicinal
uſe under the name of mummy: one is the dried fleſh of hu-
man bodies embalmed with myrrh and ſpice; the other is
the liquor running from ſuch mummies when newly prepared,
or when affected by great heat, or by damps: this is ſome-
times of a liquid, ſometimes of a ſolid form, as it is pre-
ſerved in vials well ſtopped, or ſuffered to dry and harden in
the air; the firſt kind is brought to us in large pieces, of a
lax and friable texture, light and ſpungy, of a blackiſh brown
colour, and often black and clammy on the ſurface; it is of
3 ſtrong but not agreeable ſmell: the ſecond ſort, in its
liquid ſtate, is a thick, opake, and viſcous fluid, of a blackiſh
and a ſtrong, but not diſagreeable ſmell : in its indurated
itate it is a dry, ſolid ſubſtance, of a fine ſhining black co-
lour and cloſe texture, eaſily broken, and of a good ſmell :
this ſort is extremely dear, and the firſt ſort ſo cheap, that as
all kinds of mummy are brought from Egypt we are not to
imagine it to be the ancient Egyptian mummy. What our
druggiſts are ſupplied with is the fleſh of executed criminals,
or of any other bodies the Jews can get, who fill them with
the common bitumen ſo plentiful in that part of the world,
and adding aloes, and ſome other cheap ingredients, ſend
them to be baked in an oven till the juices are exhaled, and
the embalming matter has penetrated ſo thoroughly that the
fleſh will keep. Mummy has been eſteemed reſolvent and
balſamick ; and beſides it, the ſkull, and even the moſs grow-
ing on the ſkulls of human ſkeletons, have been celebrated
for antiepileptick virtues; the fat alſo of the human body has
been recommended in rheumatiſms, and every other part or
humour have been in repute for the cure of ſome diſeaſe: at
preſent we are wiſe enough to know, that the virtues aſcribed
to the parts of the human body are all either imaginary, or
ſuch as may be found in other animal ſubſtances: the mummy
and the ſkull alone of all theſe horrid medicines retain their
places in the ſhops, Bill's Mat. Med.

form like a button, the upper part of which, as alſo the ſtalk,
is very white, but being opened, the under part is of a livid
fleſh colour, but the fleſhy part, when broken, is very white;
when they are ſuffered to remain undiſturbed, they will grow
to a large ſize, and explicate themſelves almoſt to a flatneſs,
and the red part underneath will change to a dark colour:
in order to cultivate them, open the ground about the roots
of the muſhrooms, where you will find the earth very often full

Muſk is a dry, light and friable ſubſtance of a dark blackiſh
colour, with ſome tinge of a purpliſh or blood colour in it,
feeling ſomewhat ſtudoth or unctuous: its ſinci is highly per-
fumed, and too ſtrong to be agreeable in any large quantity:
its taſte is bitteriſh: it is brought from the Eaſt Indies, moſtly
from the kingdom of Bantam, ſome from Tonquin and Co-
chin China: the animal which produces it is of a very fin-
gular kind, not agreeing with any eſtabliſhed genus ; it is of
the ſize of a common goat but taller; its head reſembles that
of the greyhound, and its ears ſtand erect like thoſe of the
rabbit: its tail is alſo erect and ſhort, its legs moderately
long, and its hoofs deeply cloven : its hair is a duſky brown,
variegated with a faint caſt of red and white, every hair being
partycoloured : the bag which contains the muſk, is three
inches long and two wide, and ſituated in the lower part of
the creature's belly; it conſiſts of a thin membrane covered
thinly with hair, reſembling a ſmall purſe, and when genuine,
the ſcent is ſo ſtrong as to offend the head greatly: toward
the orifice of the bag there are ſeveral glands, which ſerve
for the ſecretion of this precious perfume, for the ſake of
which the Indians kill the animal. Płill.
